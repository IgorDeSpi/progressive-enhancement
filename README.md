The Story of the Chinese farmer
=====

This repository contains an exercise that we had to do in order to learn how to properly write an **HTML** and **CSS** file. This exercise is done for the purpose of a training at **BeCode**.

-------------------------

## Explanations of the exercise:
1. From this text ([The Chinese Farmer](https://github.com/becodeorg/bxl-hopper-1-25/blob/master/The%20Field/3.HTML%2BCSS/0.progressive_enhancement/doc-the-chinese-farmer.txt)) , we had to restructure it in **HTML** in order to give it a logical understanding by any browser and by any user.
2. Then after having restructured it, we had to layout it, i.e. write the **CSS** code to bring the aesthetic aspect.
3. The aim of the exercise was to teach us how to put a website online with flexboxes, images and text.
